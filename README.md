# Metu-CENG 2022-2023
Clone with submodules (since some courses have their own repositories I've bound them as submodules of this root repository):
`git clone --recursive git@github.com:elmastahsin/Metu-CENG-assignment.git`

Alternatively, if you didn't use `--recursive` option while cloning, you can use:
```
cd Metu-CENG-assignment
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
